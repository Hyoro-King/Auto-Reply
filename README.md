# Auto-Reply
This is a self bot for Discord(coded in NodeJS) that can be used to automatically reply to your DMs when your AFK and can be hosted on servers to keep your account active even while you are sleeping!

### ‚ùì What is the use of this self bot?
* It's main purpose is to **automatically** reply to DM's that you get when you are AFK or asleep.
* It can also be used to keep your account active 24/7 *(You can run it on your PC or host it in a server. **More info given below**)*
* It can also be used to *\*cough\** keep your account active for some stuff like Nitro sniping, Giveaway sniping etc... üòâ

### üìùHow to Use?
* You can directly use the .exe file (Windows) provided **or** you can download (or clone) the source and run it by typing `node index.js` in command prompt or powershell or any terminal.
* **Open** your .env file. You can use any text editor such as **Notepad** to open it!
* **Initially**, your .env file will look like this:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your token here>
MESSAGE=Sorry, but I am currently AFK. I will reply to you as soon as I'm back!
```
* You can are **supposed** to replace ***\<your token here\>*** with your Discord token. If you don't know how to get your Discord token, watch this **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqSSXwcL7o0).**
* You may or may not change the **MESSAGE** part. If you like the default one, leave it at that. But if you want something else, feel free to change it.
* Once it is done, open the .exe (if you are using the easy method) or type in `node index.js` in cmd (if you are using the source code).
